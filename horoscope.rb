                and hubris. While being confident is great, you take it to the extreme 
            so that you think things that happen to other people won\'t happen to 
            you. You put yourself in dangerous situations with very little thought 
            about the consequences and you don\'t hold back when you want to say 
            something, so you can piss people off and not understand why they\'re upset.
            These are not great attributes to have when you\'re somewhere sketchy/dangerous.
            Don\'t meet someone from the internet without telling people where you\'re going, 
            and don\'t decide to hike that huge trail without proper planning. You can 
            get hurt just like anyone else; being an Aries doesn\'t always give you a pass.".green]

                    when you decide to do something, you slay it, but you rarely venture out of your
                comfort zone. You need to conquer some fears and get yourself out there. You have
                    all kinds of skills and talents that you don\'t know you have.When you accomplish
                something that you never thought you could do, it will make you feel so good about
                    yourself. You like to be comfortable but there are times when the best thing you
                    can do for yourself is to be a little uncomfortable.".green]

             top of your schedule, you\'d annoy fewer people and you wouldn\'t feel like a screw-up.
            When our homes are messy and it\'s impossible to find anything, it affects one\'s psyche.
            Declutter, organize, and put things in their place and you\'ll find that you\'ll feel

            You\'re more independent than you think, so work towards distancing yourself a little from the

            side go wild, no matter how messy and chaotic it might be.Creativity is a wonderful gift and you

            It\'s controlling to think that you can teach someone a lesson by enacting some sort of revenge and that 
            kind of negativity will cause you the most damage.Don\'t sweat the small stuff and let things go. If someone
