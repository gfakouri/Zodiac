# Zodiac

## Calista & Gareth

## Overview

- The project required the implementation of an application that could be run in the Command Line Interface. The subject choice of the application was left to the discretion of the design team. An idea that appealed was creating an interactive star sign application that would engage with the user. The intention was to make it fun and light hearted. This would fill a massive hole in the market and tap into an audience who are up for some fun and games.

## Installation

- Install bundler through the CLI

```

$ install bundler

```

- Open the main.rb file

```

$ ruby main.rb

```

- Follow the menu instructions.
- Please note there is no error handling so incorrect input types will not be detected.


## Diary
 
- idea elicitation commenced on the 27/02/18.
- Idea selection was completed on the 28/02/18. This involved  deciding between several options. The Zodiac option was chosen as it benefited from several key advantages. These were an interesting subject matter, a fun element, ability to constantly change/update content, ease of integration of third party APIâ€™s and the possibility of future feature expansion.
- Initial application structure was completed on the 28/02/18. This involved a basic UI plan, menu options and file structure.  This was subject to revision as coding progressed.
- Final Gem selection was completed on the 28/02/18. Gems selected were Zodiac, Colorize, Ruby_Emoji, Terminal-Table and Launchy. Selection was based on the application requirements and the applicable Gem documentation.
- Initial application content was selected from third party sources with a view to updating said material as the application was developed.
- Coding commenced on the 28/02/18. Initial planning led to focusing on the main file which controlled the app logic. This was completed by the end of the day. User input error handling was omitted with plans to implement if time allowed.
- Data files were created on the 01/03/18. These would be loaded into the main file. 
- Testing of the application was completed. Initial results appeared to show the application was stable. Error handling was not added due to time constraints.
- All coding was completed on the 02/03/18. 
- The report was completed on the 02/03/18.
- Formal presentation made on the 02/03/18.

## Future Features

- The application has potential for various add on features. Possibilities discussed were a Zodiac quiz, more in depth relationship advice and dating.

## Technical Difficulties

- Initial implementation of the Gems was completed without difficulty. However the outputs proved slightly limiting. After creating this application using the main Zodiac Gem with hindsight it would have been more effective to create a Gem for Star signs that produced more outputs. 

## Learning Outcomes

- The actual outputs from the gem are a key factor in how much the application can be expanded. Thorough reading of documentaion of the Gems is required prior to selecting application ideas. A different approach would be to create a gem specifically for the application.
